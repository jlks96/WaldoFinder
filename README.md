# Finding Waldo!

This is definitely not perfect, and I still have to narrow down where Waldo is but I have made it easier to search from a small subset since we know where all the red is in a certain image.

I'm going to try updating this repo with different types of matching algorithms that we can use and outline the most effective ones when I am finished.
